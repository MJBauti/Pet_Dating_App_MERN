## Description 📝

This application was built using Mongo Db, Express.js, React, and Node.js or the MERN stack. This app allows you to sign up to create your account or sign in to your existing account to begin your adventure through Pawfect Match, our non-profit dog based social media website. Once logged in you will be able to create your own profile, make text or photo posts, like posts, comment on posts, and follow others. This was meant to be created for the dog lovers out there who would like to make new freinds with other dog lovers, set up play dates, or even meet someone for yourself! As dog lovers ourselves, we added the ability to make a donation, using Stripe, to help support dogs in need of help.
