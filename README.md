## Description 📝


Welcome to our MERN stack website built with GraphQL, Apollo servers, Express, Node.js, React, and Stripe. This website is a platform for dog lovers to connect with each other and donate to local pet shelters.

Our website uses GraphQL to provide a flexible and efficient way to query and mutate data, and Apollo servers to handle GraphQL operations on the server-side. We also use Express and Node.js to build the server and handle routing, and React for the client-side interface. Finally, we utilize Stripe for secure and convenient donation processing.

Thank you for supporting our mission to improve the lives of pets in need through donations to local shelters. We hope you enjoy using our website and connecting with other dog lovers.
